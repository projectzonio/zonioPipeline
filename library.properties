sentence=Adaptive power management for ESP32 based on sensor data stability
paragraph=Revolutionary adaptive pipeline system that automatically adjusts CPU frequency and sampling intervals based on sensor data patterns. Features intelligent 4-stage power management (REACTIVE → SHORT → MEDIUM → LONG), up to 70% power reduction in stable environments, ESP32-C3 optimized including clones with low-quality crystals, plug & play integration with existing code. Built for the IoT community by project Z.O.N.I.O.
